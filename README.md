# auto-pet-feeder
A smart mechanism for feeding the pets (works for cat/dog/fish) at a scheduled interval

The goal of this project is to design a smart pet feeder that can be used to feed the pets (dog/cat/fish) automatically at a certain interval. 

Components used:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Servo Motor
3. RTC Module (real-time clock)
4. Power supply
5. 3D printed parts for the pet feeder
6. Jumper wires
7. Bread board
8. Food container

Steps involved:

1. Design and Print the Parts:
I used autodesk fusion software to design the feeder parts. Files are available in src.
Printed the parts using a 3D printer.

2. Assemble the Hardware:
Attach the servo motor to the food dispenser mechanism.
Connect the servo motor to the Arduino Uno using jumper wires.
Connect the RTC module to the Arduino to keep track of time.

3. Write the Code:
I used the Arduino IDE to write the code for controlling the servo motor and setting the feeding intervals. Code is in src.
